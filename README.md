# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.


General Outline

    Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.
    Download or otherwise retrieve the data.
    Process / Prepare the data.
    Upload the processed data to S3.
    Train a chosen model.
    Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).
    Deploy the trained model.
    Use the deployed model.
    For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
